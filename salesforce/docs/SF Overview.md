## Polish Your Personal Brand
Your social media presence is the new resume. Employers and recruiters look to social media to learn more about candidates, so it’s important to make sure your profiles are top notch and that your personal brand is epic, amazing, and every bit as professionally compelling as you are in real life.

## Salesforce Profiles
Complete your profile on Trailhead. Make sure you have a professional photo and use your newly perfected elevator pitch for your bio.
## LinkedIn
Show off the skills you’ve acquired on Trailhead by listing your badges and superbadges as well as any certifications.

Here are some questions to ask yourself in narrowing your search.
Do you prefer working for a small company or a large enterprise?
Do you prefer a startup or a more established organization?
What type of company culture do you prefer?
Do you want to work for a nonprofit or mission-driven organization or a commercial enterprise?
What industry are you most interested in?

# Basics
An app in Salesforce is a set of objects, fields, and other functionality that supports a business process. You can see which app you’re using and switch between apps using the App Launcher ( App Launcher icon).
- Objects are tables in the Salesforce database that store a particular kind of information. There are standard objects like Accounts and Contacts and custom objects like the Property object you see in the graphic.
- Records are rows in object database tables. Records are the actual data associated with an object. Here, the 211 Charles Street property is a record.
- Fields are columns in object database tables. Both standard and custom objects have fields. On our Property object, we have fields like Address and Price.

A Trailhead Playground (TP) org is a safe environment where you can practice the skills you’re learning before you take them to your real work. TP is a special type of DE.

## Use Cases:
As you start building with the platform, keep your eye out for processes with:
- Heavy email collaboration
- Reliance on spreadsheets
- Shared local documents
- Time-intensive, repetitive manual steps
- Impact on only a few departments (you want to minimize the number of stakeholders while you’re still learning)
- Processes with these traits are great candidates for early projects on the Salesforce platform.

### HR Case:
Here are some things the custom app can do.
- List job openings.
- Store applicants for each job opening.
- Send automated reminders to hiring managers.
- Store orientation and training plans.
- Manage equipment orders.
- Track employee time off.

### IT Case:
Here are some other ways to streamline IT using the Salesforce platform:
- Create reports and dashboards to aggregate and analyze requests.
- Send confirmation emails when requests are received, completed, or updated.
- Queue incoming requests.
- Create custom forms for employee requests and create a knowledge base for common issues.
- Track employee hardware assets.

Three main categories in the Setup menu:
- Administration: The Administration category is where you manage your users and data. You can do things like add users, change permissions, import and export data, and create email templates.
- Platform Tools: You do most of your customization in Platform Tools. You can view and manage your data model, create apps, modify the user interface, and deploy new features to your users. If you decide to try your hand at programmatic development, Platform Tools is where you manage your code as well.
- Settings: Finally, Settings is where you manage your company information and org security. You can do things like add business hours, change your locale, and view your org’s history.

# Strategy
Follow these steps to develop a good AppExchange strategy.
- Identify departments that use or plan to use Salesforce. These are your primary stakeholders.
- Research what’s available on AppExchange that best meets your stakeholder requirements. Discuss business cases with department heads to determine exact needs. Here are some good questions to ask:
- What business problem are you trying to solve?
- What are your main pain points right now?
- How many users need this app?
- What’s your budget?
- What’s your timeline?

These questions help you identify apps that are the best fit for each department or business case.

- When you find an app that you think meets your needs, download the app in a test environment (like a free Developer Edition or sandbox).
- Ensure that the app you’re installing doesn’t interfere with any other apps you’ve installed or customizations you’ve made.
- Sandboxes are copies of your organization in a separate environment. They’re used for development and testing.
- If you’re choosing between multiple apps, take some time to evaluate what you’ve tested. Determine whether there are feature gaps or unwanted functionality.
- If necessary, invite your stakeholders to demo the apps and provide feedback.
- You’re ready to go! You’ll install and deploy your app in your production environment.
- Make sure you keep your users in the loop about what’s changing, and provide training and documentation as necessary.

# Platform
Here are just a few ways the Salesforce Platform can help you build apps and functionality for your business.
- If you need to build a custom business application for your company or customer, the core Salesforce Platform makes it easy to develop a custom data model and application that works on desktop and mobile.
- If you need to build a customer-facing application where traffic could fluctuate unpredictably, the Heroku platform’s elastic scalability is just what you need.
- If you want to update data or integrate with other applications inside or outside of your organization, or manage customizations of your metadata, the Salesforce APIs can help you do that and much more.
- If your organization needs a better way to predict sales or product success, or know how likely customers are to buy a certain product, the Salesforce Einstein suite of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help you gather unique data and insights to predict business outcomes.
- If your organization needs a way to address a business need on the go, the Mobile SDK suite of technologies helps you develop native, HTML5, and hybrid apps for mobile devices that have the same security and reliability as the Salesforce app.

# No-Code
- Click Schema Builder. You see the whole schema of the Dreamhouse app.
- Click Auto-Layout to bring the Broker and Property custom object schemas into view.
- Click Lightning App Builder.
    - From the Lightning Pages list, select Property Record Page.
    - Notice the standard and custom objects in the left menu. You drag and drop them in the canvas in the center.
    - Now, click on several components on the canvas and notice how the properties in the right panel change, allowing you to customize each component.

To build a page like this
1. click and drag standard and custom components from the panel on the left to the canvas in the middle
2. and arrange them however you like.
3. In the right panel, you toggle between page properties and component properties when you click a component on the canvas.

Some tools like Lightning App Builder and Flow Builder are considered low-code tools. Apps and flows built using these tools are also considered low-code, because while they don’t require programmatic knowledge by default, they can be extended, combined, or further customized with code. 

For example, if you know something about logic, conditions, and CRUD operations, you can use Flow Builder to build a flow like this one in the Dreamhouse app that generates a form that gathers details to create a new property record.
- Click Flows.
- Click the Create Property flow.
- Click Run. A Create Property form appears to collect details for a new property record.
- Fill out any details you like.
- Click Next, Next, and Finish.

# Languages
- Lightning Web Component Framework: A JavaScript-based User Interface (UI) development framework similar to AngularJS or React.
- Apex: Salesforce’s proprietary programming language with Java-like syntax.
- Node.js: An asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime designed to build scalable network applications.

# Extend Platform
APIs aren’t the only ways to integrate Salesforce with the outside world. Solutions like
- SalesforceConnect,
- HerokuConnect,
- MuleSoft Composer,
- and Apex make it easy to integrate systems and data throughout your organization to address almost any business need.

Ex: Dreamhouse may integrate their Salesforce property records with an app like DocuSign for security when a homebuyer signs closing documents on their new property

Platform events let you monitor systems and communicate changes to other systems

Platform events communicate inside and outside of Salesforce using processes, flows, or Apex, or even external apps using Salesforce APIs.

Heroku is all about interacting with the outside world. Heroku is an elastic scale solution to quickly build, deploy, and scale web apps.

# Data Modeling
- Create a House Custom Object
- Object Manager -> Create Object from Spreadsheet

# Features
Creating a custom object was easy enough. But modern applications require:
- An intuitive user interface to interact with the records efficiently
- APIs to integrate with other systems and processes
- A mobile application
- Security
- User management with identity and authentication services for the end users of the app

Application Data Security with record-level sharing, and entity-level and field-level security. 

The ability to access data and schema of custom objects via API. The object schema and all of the records you've created can be accessed using an automatically generated REST API.

An authentication and authorization-enabled User object to manage identity and access for the end users of your app.

# Create App
- Select App Manager.
- Click New Lightning App.

# .
Lightning web components are custom HTML elements that use the Web Components standards and are built with HTML and modern JavaScript.

A Lightning web component (LWC) runs in the browser natively and allows developers to customize the out-of-the-box user interface.
