# Setup
- As the Admin user, enable Dev Hub in your Developer Edition.
- If you want your dev team to create scratch orgs, add them to your Dev Hub org.
- In the Dev Hub, enable Second-Generation Packaging.
- Enable source tracking in your sandbox.

# Basic
- Trailhead org === DE org with packages installed.
- No need to create, challenges ask you to connect.
- Login for CLI.
  - App Launcher -> Playground Starter -> Get Your Login Credentials or Setup -> Users -> Username -> Reset
- You can connect, disconnect, or rename your Trailhead Playgrounds to keep yourself organized.
- From any hands-on challenge or project step, click the name of your playground and then click Manage Orgs.

# Install App/Package
- To install an app or package in your Trailhead Playground, you just need the package ID provided in the Trailhead content.
  - This is a long string that starts with 04t—you’ll know it when you see it.
  - App Launcher -> Playground Starter -> Install a Package -> Admin Only
- Take a look at that installation link. Does it begin with appexchange.salesforce.com?
  - If so, you’re installing an app, not a package, and you can skip to the next section, Install an AppExchange App.
- Use private window to install at correct place (trailhead org) not already logged-in org.
  - Copy the package installation link and paste it into your private browsing window.
  - You’ll be prompted to log in.
  - Enter the username and password of your Trailhead Playground and click Log In.
  - Select Install for Admins Only, check the checkbox below it, then click Install.
